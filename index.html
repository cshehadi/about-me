  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>I am web developer at Gotham Writers Workshop.  I've been working there on and off since 1993. I currently live in Brooklyn, NY and I've got two daughters, ages 6 and 10.
    Here's my web site: <a href="http://charlesshehadi.com" target="_blank">Charlie's web site</a></p>
  <p>As for what's important to me? Learning, growing, treating people decently, and living on a sane, safe and stable planet.</p>

  <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
  <p>I grew up in Princeton, New Jersey, in a family of 3 kids.  My father was a philosophy professor and amateur singer of art songs, my mother, a high-school math teacher.  We travelled quite a bit.  I spent pre-school in London and Rome, 6th grade in Paris.</p>

  <h2>More About Me</h2>
  <h3>What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>
  <p>Listening to music, eating, following the Minnesota Vikings, and playing with my kids.  I'm also learning to play the piano.</p>
  <h3>What's your dream job?</h3>
  <p>Since I'm typing this at work, and someone could be looking over my shoulder, it's my current job, of course: Director of Technology at Gotham Writers Workshop.</p>
  <h3>What's your background?</h3>
  <p>A B.A. in philosophy from Vassar, an M.A. from the School of Visual Arts in Computer Art. 20 years of back-end web development.</p>
  <h3>What music have you been listening to lately?</h3>
  <p>Normally my tastes are pretty eclectic.  I listen to classical (Beethoven, Brahms), jazz (Charlie Parker, Bill Frisell, John Scofield), and more recent music like RadioHead, The Strokes, and Spoon.  Also, when I was in high school I was a huge prog rock fan, so I have to admit to still having a soft spot for that stuff. Bloated and silly as it was, I still get a kick out of it.</p>
  <p>My eldest daughter just discovered Rock and Roll.  I've been trying to remember what I liked at her age, so I can introduce her to it.  So lately, I've been listening to Electric Light Orchestra, my favorite band when I was 10.  It's a fun trip down memory lane, listening to music I probably haven't listened to for about 35 years.  It's amazing how much of it I remember. That stuff you love when you're young gets burned into your soul - so you still love it, even if you end up seeing it as complete cheeseball music when you're an adult.</p>
